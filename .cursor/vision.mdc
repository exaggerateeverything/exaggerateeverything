# Vision (Cursor Rule)

## When generating features, architecture, or UX:
- Always align with the platform vision described in `/context/vision.md`.
- This project is an art-focused platform for sharing wisdom, not typical social media.
- Prioritize simplicity, quietness, and minimal interaction noise.
- The experience should feel dreamlike and spontaneous (floating pages, gentle movement).

## When generating backend or workflow logic:
- Support text uploads, manual entry, and an optional AWS SMS pipeline.
- Store quotes and user messages in DynamoDB.
- Respect the Tao Te Ching–inspired character limit.
- Enable personalization: “How are you feeling today?” affects what is shown.

## When designing interaction systems:
- Implement a Dark Souls–style upvote system.
- Implement private “pings” visible only to the receiver.
- Include light moderation (slur filtering).

## When generating brush or canvas features:
- Auto-smooth strokes to produce elegant writing.
- Maintain separate black and white theme versions.

## When dealing with algorithms:
- Consider multiple content-display algorithms.
- Pages should float, drift, and feel spontaneous.

## When interpreting project goals:
- Favor human expression over AI-generated content.
- Maintain the platform’s aesthetic and emotional tone at all times.
