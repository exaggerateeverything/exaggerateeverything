# Fonts Context (MDC)

GOAL:
Typography must be completely flexible. The system must support dynamic font swapping, Google Fonts integration, and custom user-uploaded fonts. Defaults must remain clean and minimal.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide centralized font loading (Google Fonts + custom fonts).
- Allow per-component or global hot swapping of fonts.
- Allow custom uploaded fonts (TTF/OTF/WOFF/WOFF2).
- Keep Tailwind font configuration clean, minimal, and extensible.
- Maintain the minimalist design philosophy (calm, clear, functional).
- Avoid hardcoded typography. All font choices must be overridable.
- Ensure accessibility: readable size defaults and scalable line height.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Use Tailwind’s theme.fontFamily with named tokens.
- Consider @fontsource or Google Fonts CSS import for fast swapping.
- For user fonts, support upload -> storage -> @font-face generation.
- Keep font tooling consistent across Laravel, React, Tailwind, and Inertia.

AI BEHAVIOR:
- When generating UI, assume typography is fluid.
- Prefer references to the defined font tokens instead of direct font names.
- When suggesting UI variations, AI may propose alternative fonts but must remain minimal and aligned with the core design philosophy.
