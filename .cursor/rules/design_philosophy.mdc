# Design Philosophy (Cursor Rule)

## When generating UI, CSS, layout, or interactive behavior:
- Always follow the principles in `/context/design_philosophy.md`.
- Default to black and white. Use color only in rare, meaningful situations.
- Preserve negative space. Avoid clutter and decorative noise.
- Keep text small and elegant unless emphasis is required.
- Honor Kenya Hara–style minimalism: clean, empty, subtle.

## When proposing UI components or layouts:
- Prioritize calm, breathable layouts.
- Light/dark mode must be symmetrical in tone.
- Interactions should feel soft, smooth, and intentional.

## When generating markup tool features:
- Brush strokes must be auto-smoothed to look refined.
- Pages combine text + brush strokes + background.
- Maintain aesthetic consistency between light and dark themes.

## When generating or modifying any user-facing content:
- The vibe should remain minimalist, contemplative, and timeless.
