# UI / UX Rules (Cursor)

## General
- Always adhere to the minimal, black-and-white, Kenya Hara–inspired aesthetic from `/context/ui_ux.md`.
- Avoid clutter. Avoid color. Avoid gradient-heavy or pattern-based designs.
- Favor heavy negative space and small, elegant typography.

## Layout
- Use clean, restrained layouts.
- Do not introduce unnecessary UI elements, boxes, borders, or shadows.
- Instead rely on spacing, contrast, and alignment.

## Page Display
- Floating pages must animate subtly.
- No spring physics, jiggle animations, or noisy transitions.
- drifting, fading, or gently moving elements are acceptable.

## Writing Experience
- Use minimal toolbars and controls.
- The brush tool must be smoothed and corrected for elegance.
- Maintain separate black/white theme versions.

## Interactions
- Upvotes must be subtle and symbolic (Dark Souls style).
- Private pings are visible only to the receiver.
- Prevent AI-generated content unless explicitly allowed.

## Navigation
- Keep navigation extremely minimal.
- Prioritize simplicity and conceptual clarity.

## Tone
- The UX should feel contemplative, calm, and intentional.
