# Design Philosophy

The entire platform should feel clean, spacious, and intentional. Black and white are the foundation. Color is allowed but should be used with extreme restraint — only where it truly matters. The design should echo Kenya Hara’s philosophy from *Designing Design* and *100 Whites*: embrace emptiness, subtlety, and quiet beauty.

## Visual Identity
- Black and white first.  
- Negative space is a primary design element.  
- Text is small and elegant.  
- Large text appears only to emphasize something important.  
- Avoid visual clutter.  
- Everything should feel breathable and calm.

## The Experience
The interface should feel like a peaceful, timeless place — almost meditative. Users encounter wisdom the way they might encounter a page of the *Tao Te Ching*: simple, minimal, direct, and slightly mysterious.

Content presentation should feel dreamy and spontaneous, like pages drifting in space. Users can hover or tap to reveal or select them.

## Markup & Interaction
Users can “mark up” their page with a black or white brush (depending on theme). The strokes should be smoothed and corrected so that anyone’s writing looks elegant. Each page is ultimately a combination of:
- text  
- brush strokes  
- a background (black or white)

## Theme Behavior
- Light mode: white background, black text and brush.
- Dark mode: black background, white text and brush.
- Switching themes should not break the layout or aesthetic.

## Purpose of Restraint
The minimalist approach is not just aesthetic — it guides the emotional tone:

- No noise.  
- No clutter.  
- No dopamine loops.  
- No algorithmic chaos.  

Just a quiet interface for sharing human wisdom.

## Anti-AI Philosophy
AI-generated content should be discouraged. The platform is meant for human expression — raw, imperfect, emotional. Any anti-AI measures should preserve the spirit of the place without being intrusive.

## Core Vibe
Plain. Quiet. Thoughtful.  
Elegance born from what you *don’t* show.
