# UI / UX Guidelines

The UI and UX should embody calm, restraint, and intentional design. The entire experience must feel like stepping into a silent, black-and-white gallery curated by Kenya Hara. Minimal, elegant, and centered around negative space.

This is not a social media feed.  
This is a contemplative environment.

## Core Design Principles
- **Plain black and white:** No color unless absolutely necessary.
- **Heavy negative space:** Breathing room everywhere.
- **Small, elegant text:** Large text appears only for emphasis.
- **Silence:** No visual noise, no clutter.
- **Human elements:** Imperfection and handwriting are encouraged.
- **Tao Te Ching energy:** Simple, sparse, poetic.

## Layout Philosophy
The interface should feel like:
- A quiet blank page.
- A floating field of “thought fragments.”
- A minimal gallery composed entirely of text and brush marks.

Where typical apps rely on boxes, cards, shadows, and borders, this one relies on **space**, **alignment**, **contrast**, and **typography**.

## Page Display (Floating Pages)
Pages should drift, float, or softly appear.
The user should explore by hovering, tapping, sliding through this light cloud of notes.

Key behaviors:
- Pages animate subtly, never bounce or spring.
- Movement feels dreamy, slow, and guided by chance.
- Users can choose world / country / self contexts for what floats.

## Reading Experience
- A page opens like a calm note.
- No distracting UI around it.
- Text is the focus.
- Margins are wide.
- Only black and white versions exist.
- Brush strokes appear seamlessly alongside the text.

## Writing Experience
Writing should feel like placing a thought onto a quiet sheet of paper.

Features:
- Minimal toolbar.
- Auto-smoothing brush for elegant strokes.
- Black brush in light mode; white brush in dark mode.
- Real-time preview of the final composite.
- Character limit equals longest Tao Te Ching page.

## Interactions
- **Dark Souls–style upvote**: Subtle, symbolic, not numerical.
- **Private “pings”**: Users can leave gentle feedback for others, seen only by the receiver.
- **Optional comments**: Not threaded “discourse”—more like a tiny whisper.
- **Content filtering**: Only for slurs or hateful content; otherwise free expression.

## Navigation
- Simple global nav, perhaps one line of text.
- Nothing flashy.
- Maybe just:
  - Explore  
  - Write  
  - Profile  
  - About  

## Personalization
The “How are you feeling today?” input should quietly influence what surfaces.  
This should feel indirect, intuitive, never algorithmically loud.

## Branding & Visual Identity
- Inspired by Kenya Hara’s *white*, *emptiness*, and *silence* aesthetics.
- Layouts resemble art books more than websites.
- Typography is delicate, consistent, understated.
- Absolutely avoid gradients, shadows, or loud components.

## Mobile UX
- The floating environment compresses into a vertical drift.
- Taps replace hovers.
- The writing environment must feel like a minimal journal.

## Desktop UX
- More space = more floating pages.
- Larger landscape for contemplation.
- Hover interactions reveal subtle details.

## Emotional Tone
The UI should make the user feel:
- Calm  
- Reflected  
- Present  
- Creative  
- Connected without noise  

A digital sanctuary.
